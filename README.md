## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, please go to https://ajprobel.github.io/weather-dashboard/

Enter any city name into the search field, and watch the weather data appear!

Weather data includes an icon representing the overall weather, temperature data in Celsius, humidity, and wind speed in meters/second. You can see today's weather, as well as an overview for the next 5 days.

Previous searches are saved in a list underneath the search bar. Coming for patch 1 - clicking the past searches will update the info on screen!
